# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Bangla-Restuarent-Review-by-SVM
Here I used SVM.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 
It is a popular algorithm known for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional and complex datasets. 
SVM works by finding an optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes.
I got 66.75% accuracy.

Dataset discription:
The Restaurant reviews [3] dataset used in this paper was abstractly translated into Bangla.
There were five types of aspect categories, that is, Food, Price, Service, Ambiance, and Miscellaneous.
As the objective was to identify the aspect category and corresponding polarity, the participants did
not add aspect terms or their polarities. In terms of the polarity of an aspect category, we considered
only three polarity labels, that is, positive, negative and neutral. The original dataset consisted of four
different polarity labels: positive, negative, neutral, and conflict. In our translated Bangla dataset,
we omitted the conflict category and assumed it to be the same as the neutral category. The annotators
were asked to assign each translated Bangla restaurant review into their categories and their polarities
for the original dataset. Table 8 shows a sample of the translated Restaurant dataset.
